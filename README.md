### My attempt at Google's foobar challenge

**Level 1-** I didn't record the first level of tasks, if anyone can remind me what they were I'll gladly rewrite the solutions as they were a pleasantly gentle beginning (It definitely got tougher)

**Level 2 -** If I recall there was 3 tasks in this level, observe I only have two files in there, again if anyone knows what the other was, let me know!

**Level 3 -** This is where things really began to require thinking about for a while, I found myself reading the task & deliberating away from keyboard until the timer was almost up each time

**Level 4 -** @todo

**Level 5 -** @todo
